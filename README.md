# DSA Repository

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in Python/JavaScript. Each concept is organized in a separate branch, allowing you to track your progress and easily switch between different concepts.

## Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [Data Structure 1](link/to/branch) | Brief description of the data structure and its usage. |
| [Algorithm 1](link/to/branch) | Brief description of the algorithm and its application. |
| [Data Structure 2](link/to/branch) | Brief description of the data structure and its usage. |
| [Algorithm 2](link/to/branch) | Brief description of the algorithm and its application. |
| ...     | ...         |

Feel free to explore each branch to learn more about the implementation details and see code examples.
